<div><h3 Style=color:slategray>Venice, Italy</h3>
<p><strong>The City of Water.</strong> venivce was interesting because to get anywhere you either had to walk 
or take a boat. It waas beautiful though, something that you would never see anywhere else.
We toured the city by water on the canals and dined at Cafe Florian and Hotel Danieli. We toured
Doge's palce, the residence of the former Republic of Venice's ruler Because our time in Venice was the least scheduled out,
we used <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g187870-Activities-Venice_Veneto.html"> trip advisor </a> and other websites like it to find things to do or places to eat. </p></div>
